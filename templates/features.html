            <h2>Gesture To Text Conversion</h2>
            <p>
            This feature allows the system to interpret hand gestures and convert them into written text in real-time.
            Using AI models like MediaPipe and computer vision techniques, the system recognizes specific hand signs and displays the corresponding message on the screen.

            <h2>Voice-to-Gesture Conversion</h2>
            <p>In this module, the user can speak a command, and the system converts the voice input into a matching hand gesture using a database or AI mapping. </p>

        <div class="feature">
    
            <h2>Real-time Gesture Recognition</h2>
            <p>
                With the help of computer vision frameworks like MediaPipe, the system continuously captures hand movements via webcam and processes them instantly. 
                Each gesture is detected in real-time and immediately classified to trigger specific actions or text responses.

        <div class="feature">
           
            <h2>Database Storage</h2>
            <p>This feature supports a customizable experience by storing voice commands, text messages, and their corresponding hand gestures in a database (like MySQL). 
                The system can learn and adapt over time, offering personalized mappings and enabling user-defined gesture-command combinations.

            <h2>Faster Interaction </h2>
            <p> Hand gestures can be used as shortcuts to perform everyday tasks such as turning 
                on/off lights, adjusting fan speed, or controlling smart TVs. This enables 
                quick, intuitive, and contactless control, ideal for smart homes and offices.

        <div class="feature">
          
            <h2>Helps Disabled Individuals </h2>
            <p> Gesture recognition systems empower individuals with speech or hearing impairments
                to communicate effectively through signs. The system translates their hand gestures 
                into understandable language, ensuring inclusivity and independence.

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p> This technology can be used as a learning tool in schools and training centers 
                to teach sign language interactively. Students can practice and receive feedback 
                in real-time, making learning more engaging and effective.

            <h2>Healthcare & Assistive Tech</h2>
            <p> In healthcare settings, especially for patients with mobility or communication challenges,
                gesture recognition systems allow for touch-free control of medical devices or assistance tools.
                This enhances safety, hygiene, and ease of use in clinical environments.
